# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
I used my creativity to write a program which uses turtle to draw a picture of a house on a street during the nighttime with the moon out. The house has small details to make it as realistic as possible.
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
Return in the function - I am not sure what I should return since the function already completes the task.
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
I tried to be as creative and clean as possible.
