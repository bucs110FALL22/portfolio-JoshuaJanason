# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
My program involes two APis with one being images of cats and another being gifs/images of cats which have information/tags along side of the respective cat. The program asks the user how many images they want from one API, how many they want from another, and/or if they want both of the APIs to return something.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
The known bugs/incomplete parts is the combining of the two APIs and using the input from the user into the program after they enter in a number into the terminal. Also, no image/gif was returned.

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
The two APIs I used:
- https://http.cat/
- https://cataas.com/doc.html

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
Overall, I wasn't too sure how I could implement the APIs and its information into a fully functioning program.
